# Two-Die-Random-Walk-Model
Simulation of a random walk of two die to roll at least one 4

2/13/17

Code for modeling a random walk for one of my tutoring student's stats homework. The question was how long would it take on average to roll at least one 4 using two die through 60 trials?

Update 10/23/17

Added the code for the Shiny app of the random walk model. It can be seen at: https://jslucf.shinyapps.io/random_walk_simulator/
